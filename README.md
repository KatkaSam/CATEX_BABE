CATEX_BABE

This repository contains an RStudio project for analyzing data on the predation rates in forest canopies and understories of six forest sites spanning a latitudinal gradinet. 

It contains data on number of attacks on dummy caterpillars from trees across six sites spanning 51°N to 33°S, covering temperate and tropical regions:

Leipzig in Germany, Tomakomai in Japan, Bubeng in China, Kakoba in Papua New Guinea, and Cairns and Sydney in Australia. 

The manuscript is currently in review, with core session data and history preserved for reproducibility.

Project Structure Data: Contains 8 input and 14 output sheets, with raw as well as summarized data reporting number of dummy caterpillars attacked by various types of predators,

data on the densities of predators and LAI index at the sites.

Figures: Includes 15 Figures ready for the manuscript - for the main body as well as for the Supplements

Scripts: Includes 17 items of the R files with all scripts used in the manuscript CATEX_BABE: The RStudio project file to open the analysis environment.
